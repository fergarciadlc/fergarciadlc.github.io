## The Sound Of AI
My passion for music and AI led me to join international initiatives at The Sound Of AI (TSOAI), mentored by Dr. Valerio Velardo. This involvement enhanced my career and deepened my understanding in audio, music, and AI.

<p>
    I contributed significantly to the <a href="https://thesoundofaiosr.github.io/">Open Source Research</a> project, a collaborative effort with over 200 TSOAI community members. My key achievement was co-authoring "<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7088416">From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors</a>" for the 3rd Conference on <a href="https://aimusiccreativity.org/">AI Music Creativity</a> (2022). As Project Manager, I led team coordination and communication efforts. Additionally, as a programmer, I contributed to the development of a voice-activated neural synthesizer.

Open Source Research finished successfully in September 2022 after 2 years of work.
