My name is Fernando. I am an engineer, audio developer, musician, entrepreneur, and technology enthusiast. My academic path started with a strong passion for music, working on my guitar skills from a young age.

My interest in music, science, and technology inspired me to earn a Bachelor's in Communications and Electronics Engineering with a focus on Acoustics. In university, I explored DSP, Signals and Systems, Physics, Acoustics and Music Technology. I enhanced my learning with hands-on experiences like self-taught software development, guitar teaching, and involvement in music production projects, activities that I pursued while studying.

You can check my project on my [portfolio](/portfolio/), feel free to reach out! üòÅ
