My name is Fernando. I am an engineer, audio developer, musician, entrepreneur, and technology enthusiast. My academic path started with a strong passion for music, working on my guitar skills from a young age.

My interest in music, science, and technology inspired me to earn a Bachelor's in Communications and Electronics Engineering with a focus on Acoustics. In university, I explored DSP, Signals and Systems, Physics, Acoustics and Music Technology. I enhanced my learning with hands-on experiences like self-taught software development, guitar teaching, and involvement in music production projects, activities that I pursued while studying.

My passion for music and AI led me to join international initiatives at The Sound Of AI (TSOAI), mentored by Dr. Valerio Velardo. This involvement enhanced my career and deepened my understanding in audio, music, and AI.

At Ear Candy Technologies (ECT), a Mexican startup, I'm an audio developer and DSP engineer, focusing on creating new audio plugins and developing audio processing algorithms. Utilizing my data engineering background, I also manage our plugins' cloud infrastructure, sharpening my technical and creative skills.
