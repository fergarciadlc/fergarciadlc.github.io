[{"content":"My name is Fernando. I am an engineer, audio developer, musician, entrepreneur, and technology enthusiast. My academic path started with a strong passion for music, working on my guitar skills from a young age.\nMy interest in music, science, and technology inspired me to earn a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s in Communications and Electronics Engineering with a focus on Acoustics. In university, I explored DSP, Signals and Systems, Physics, Acoustics and Music Technology. I enhanced my learning with hands-on experiences like self-taught software development, guitar teaching, and involvement in music production projects, activities that I pursued while studying.\nYou can check my project on my portfolio, feel free to reach out! 😁\n","date":"26 November 2023","permalink":"/about/","section":"Fernando Garcia","summary":"My name is Fernando.","title":"About"},{"content":" Work Experience Globant Everis Education Engineering in electronics and communications - IPN Certifications Platzi Python ","date":"26 November 2023","permalink":"/cv/","section":"Fernando Garcia","summary":" Work Experience Globant Everis Education Engineering in electronics and communications - IPN Certifications Platzi Python ","title":"CV"},{"content":" ","date":"26 November 2023","permalink":"/publications/conferences-and-talks/2022/ec-meeting/","section":"Publications","summary":" ","title":"EC Meeting 2022"},{"content":"Hi There!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Fernando! software engineer, audio developer, data engineer, guitar player, scientific communicator, and music-audio-ai enthusiast.

This involvement enhanced my career and deepened my understanding in audio, music, and AI.\nThe Sound Of AI Accelerator TSOAI Accelerator for music AI startups I served as the Assistant Director for the first Sound of AI Accelerator, a startup accelerator in music-audio-AI. My responsibilities included program organization, team support, and coordinating with mentors and speakers. April 11th to July 2nd 2023 1st The Sound Of AI Hackathon TSOAI Hackahthon music AI startups I played a key role in organizing and participating in the 1st The Sound of AI Hackathon, which focused on audio and music technology. My team developed Modelizer, a real-time audio processing VST using neural networks. 8-10 July 2022 Open Source Research TSOAI Collaborative research project I contributed significantly to the Open Source Research project, a collaborative effort with over 200 TSOAI community members. My key achievement was co-authoring \"From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors\" for the 3rd Conference on AI Music Creativity (2022). As Project Manager, I led team coordination and communication efforts. Additionally, as a programmer, I contributed to the development of a voice-activated neural synthesizer. Open Source Research finished successfully in September 2022 after 2 years of work. Ear Candy Technologies At Ear Candy Technologies (ECT), a Mexican startup, I\u0026rsquo;m an audio developer and DSP engineer, focusing on creating new audio plugins and developing audio processing algorithms. Utilizing my data engineering background, I also manage our plugins\u0026rsquo; cloud infrastructure, sharpening my technical and creative skills.\nCheckout our plugins!\nSome open source projects with ECT: Ear-Candy-Technologies/Amaranth Open Source Synthesizer Plug-in C\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 6 1 Ear-Candy-Technologies/intro-audio-plugins-distortion-2023 Taller: Introducción a la programación de plug-ins de audio con distorsión C\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 1 0 Ear-Candy-Technologies/intro-audio-plugins-expoacustica-2023 Taller: Introducción a la programación de Plug-ins de audio - Expoacustica 2023 - IPN C\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 3 0 DSP Tools fergarciadlc/gentone Command-line program to generate Waveform Audio Format (wav) files of pure tones and synth waveforms.
