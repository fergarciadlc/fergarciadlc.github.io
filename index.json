This involvement enhanced my career and deepened my understanding in audio, music, and AI.\nThe Sound Of AI Accelerator TSOAI Accelerator for music AI startups (April to July 2023) Show Content I served as the Assistant Director for the first Sound of AI Accelerator, a startup accelerator in music-audio-AI. My responsibilities included program organization, team support, and coordinating with mentors and speakers. April 11th to July 2nd 2023 1st The Sound Of AI Hackathon TSOAI Hackathon music AI startups (July 2022) Show Content I played a key role in organizing and participating in the 1st The Sound of AI Hackathon, which focused on audio and music technology. My team developed Modelizer, a real-time audio processing VST using neural networks. 8-10 July 2022 Open Source Research TSOAI Collaborative research project (September 2022) Show Content I contributed significantly to the Open Source Research project, a collaborative effort with over 200 TSOAI community members. My key achievement was co-authoring \"From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar Sounds with Timbral Descriptors\" for the 3rd Conference on AI Music Creativity (2022). As Project Manager, I led team coordination and communication efforts. Additionally, as a programmer, I contributed to the development of a voice-activated neural synthesizer. Open Source Research finished successfully in September 2022 after 2 years of work. Ear Candy Technologies At Ear Candy Technologies (ECT), a Mexican startup, I\u0026rsquo;m an audio developer and DSP engineer, focusing on creating new audio plugins and developing audio processing algorithms.
