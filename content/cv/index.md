## Projects

Personal Open Source projects can be found in my
[github](https://github.com/fergarciadlc) and
[portflolio](https://fergarciadlc.github.io/portfolio/).

**The Sound of AI Accelerator** \
I served as the Assistant Director for the first [Sound of AI
Accelerator](https://thesoundofai.com/accelerator.html), a startup
accelerator in music-audio-AI. My responsibilities included program
organization, team support, and coordinating with mentors and speakers.

**1st The Sound Of AI Hackathon**\
I played a key role in organizing and participating in the [1st The
Sound of AI
Hackathon](https://musikalkemist.github.io/thesoundofaihackathon/),
which focused on audio and music technology. My team developed
[Modelizer](https://github.com/rodoortiz/Modelizer), a real-time audio
processing VST using neural networks.

**Open Source Research**\
I contributed significantly to the [Open Source
Research](https://thesoundofaiosr.github.io/) project, a collaborative
effort with over 200 TSOAI community members. My key achievement was
co-authoring \"From Words to Sound: Neural Audio Synthesis of Guitar
Sounds with Timbral Descriptors\" for the 3rd Conference on AI Music
Creativity (2022). As Project Manager, I led team coordination and
communication efforts. Additionally, as a programmer, I contributed to
the development of a voice-activated neural synthesizer.

**Reverberation time measurement using Matlab**\
The project aimed to develop a Matlab-based program for the measurement
of reverberation time, using basic audio equipment (Microphone, speaker,
and audio interface).

**Intelligent Interpreter (Hackathon BBVA 2020)**\
OCR ML model for the automation of the transcription task in the bank
environment by the usage of the Google Vision API, the communication was
implemented through an API REST application using Python and Flask and
presented within a web service.

**Selected Open Source Projects for music technology**:
[Orbit](https://github.com/fergarciadlc/orbit/), [Harmonic
Playlist](https://github.com/fergarciadlc/harmonic-playlist/),
[Mictlan](https://github.com/fergarciadlc/mictlan/),
[Amaranth](https://github.com/Ear-Candy-Technologies/Amaranth),
[gentone](https://github.com/fergarciadlc/gentone/),
[FFT-conv-decv](https://github.com/fergarciadlc/FFT-conv-decv/).


## Conferences and Talks
**Audio Developer Conference 2023**\
Attendee, and workshops on Cmajor and Entrepreneurship.\
**Socios Formadores (ITESM)**\
During August 2023, I participated with Ear Candy Technologies in a set
of workshops with JUCE for the program Socios Formadores at Technol√≥gico
de Monterrey, campus Mexico City and Puebla.\
**Expoacustica 2023 (IPN)**\
May 2023, I participated with Ear Candy Technologies in IPN expoacustica
2023, international congress on Acoustics. I presented a Workshop and a
conference on Audio Plugins.\
**Mexsynthco 2023**\
September 2023, with Ear Candy Technologies presented
[Amaranth](https://github.com/Ear-Candy-Technologies/Amaranth), an open
source synth, presented about the project.\
**Ear Candy Meetings 2022**\
This [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR77i7GtLb8) is about a use
case for the Spotify API, where you can select a song of your choice and
generate a playlist based on its style and the same music key as the
reference song.
