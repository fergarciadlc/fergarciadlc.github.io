My name is Fernando. I am currently pursuing an **MSc in Sound and Music Computing** at Universitat Pompeu Fabra's Music Technology Group in Barcelona, where I work as a research assistant developing audio plugins and real-time processing systems.

My journey began with a passion for music and guitar from a young age, which led me to earn a **Bachelor's in Communications and Electronics Engineering** with a focus on **Acoustics**. During my studies, I explored DSP, signal processing, physics, and music technology while gaining hands-on experience in software development, guitar teaching, and music production.

Currently, I'm involved in exciting research projects including the development of [**essentia-plugins**](https://github.com/MTG/essentia-plugins) - a collection of real-time audio analysis plugins using the Essentia library and JUCE framework. I recently completed internships at **Dolby Laboratories** working on C++ audio libraries and AI research projects.

I'm also active in the audio development community - I was a **speaker at Audio Developer Conference 2024** where I presented ["Rock-Solid Releases"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKvPupqq9YE) about CI/CD practices for audio developers.

When I'm not coding or researching, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, scientific communication, and exploring the intersection of music, technology, and AI.

You can check my projects in my [portfolio](/portfolio/) or **[watch my ADC24 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKvPupqq9YE)**! Feel free to reach out! üòÅ
