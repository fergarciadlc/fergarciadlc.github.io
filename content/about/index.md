**Engineer, musician, and curious mind** - hi, I'm Fernando!

I‚Äôm pursuing an **MSc in Sound & Music Computing** at Universitat Pompeu Fabra‚Äôs Music Technology Group (Barcelona), exploring the intersection of **audio, music, technology, and AI**. My work blends research, engineering, and creativity.

**Some highlights from my journey:**
- **Dolby Laboratories** ‚Äî Software Engineering Intern: contributed to **C++ audio libraries**, **DSP pipelines**, and prototyped **ML-driven sound analysis tools**.
- **Audio Developer** ‚Äî At [Ear Candy Technologies](https://earcandytech.com/) and [MTG](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg), built [audio plug‚Äëins](https://earcandytech.com/plugins) with the JUCE Framework, implemented **CI/CD pipelines**, and handled **DevOps** for audio software.
- **Open-source** ‚Äî Lead developer of **[essentia‚Äëplugins](https://github.com/MTG/essentia-plugins)**, a real-time audio analysis toolkit using JUCE and [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/).
- **Data Engineering** ‚Äî Designed **ETL processes**, databases, APIs, and deployed ML models into production.
- **Community** ‚Äî Speaker at **Audio Developer Conference 2024**: *[Rock-Solid Releases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKvPupqq9YE)* on CI/CD for audio developers. Contributor to several initiatives from [The Sound of AI](https://thesoundofai.com/) with [Valerio Velardo](https://valeriovelardo.com/).

When I‚Äôm not coding or researching, you'll find me playing guitar, at the gym, or taking photos with my camera.
